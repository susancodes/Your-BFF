#Your BFF

Planning a trip is disheartening if you keep looking at your dream vacation and then at your economically disadvantaged bank account. Your BFF (Budget Flight Finder) takes away the frustrations of searching for travel destinations by showing you a list of roundtrip flights that fit your budget. If your budget canâ€™t afford flights, your BFF will give you a list of nearby campsites for possible road trip plans. Knowing your options will help you explore the world!
